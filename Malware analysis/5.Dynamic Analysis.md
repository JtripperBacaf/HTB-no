In dynamic analysis, we observe and interpret the behavior of the malware while it is running, or in action. This is a critical contrast to static analysis, where we dissect the malware's properties and contents without executing it. The primary goal of dynamic analysis is to document and understand the real-world impact of the malware on its host environment, making it an integral part of comprehensive malware analysis.

step:

- `Environment setup`:establish a secure and controlled environment
- `Baseline Capture`:capture a snapshot of the system's clean state.Including `system files`,`registry states`,`running processes`,`network configuration`
- `Tool Deployment(Pre-Execution)`:Deploy some tool for analysis like `Process Monitor`,`Wireshark`,`tcpdump`,`Regshot`,`INetSim`.`FakeDNS`,`FakeNet-NG`to simulate internet services.
- `Malware Execution`
- `Observation and Logging`
- `Analysis of collected Data`

In some cases, when the malware is particularly evasive or complex, we might employ sandboxed environments for dynamic analysis. Sandboxes, such as `Cuckoo Sandbox`, `Joe Sandbox`, or `FireEye's Dynamic Threat Intelligence cloud`, provide an automated, safe, and highly controlled environment for malware execution. 

# 1.Dynamic Analysis with Noriben

 It uses `ProcMon` to capture system events but then filters and analyzes this data to extract meaningful information and pinpoint malicious activities.

- Setting Up Noriben
- Launching ProcMon
- Executiing the Malware Sample
- Monitoring and logging
- Data Analysis and Reporting

```shell
python Noriben.py
```
