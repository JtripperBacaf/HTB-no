# 1.Introduction

Type of different malware:

- `Viruses`: These notorious forms of malware are designed to infiltrate and multiply within host files, transitioning from one system to another. They latch onto credible programs, springing into action when the infected files are triggered. Their destructive powers can range from corrupting or altering data to disrupting system functions, and even spreading through networks, inflicting widespread havoc.
- `Worms`: Worms are autonomous malware capable of multiplying across networks without needing human intervention. They exploit network weaknesses to infiltrate systems without permission. Once inside, they can either deliver damaging payloads or keep multiplying to other vulnerable devices. Worms can initiate swift and escalating infections, resulting in enormous disruption and even potential denial of service attacks.
- `Trojans`: Also known as Trojan Horses, these are disguised as genuine software to trick users into running them. Upon entering a system, they craft backdoors, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized control remotely. Trojans can be weaponized to pilfer sensitive data, such as passwords or financial information, and orchestrate other harmful activities on the compromised system.
- `Ransomware`: This malicious type of malware encrypts files on the target's system, making them unreachable. Attackers then demand a ransom in return for the decryption key, effectively holding the victim's data to ransom. The impacts of ransomware attacks can debilitate organizations and individuals alike, leading to severe financial and reputational harm.
- `Spyware`: This type of malware stealthily gathers sensitive data and user activities without their consent. It can track online browsing habits, record keystrokes, and capture login credentials, posing a severe risk to privacy and security. The pilfered data is often sent to remote servers for harmful purposes.
- `Adware`: Though not as destructive, adware can still be an annoyance and a security threat. It shows uninvited and invasive advertisements on infected systems, often resulting in a poor user experience. Adware may also track user behavior and collect data for targeted advertising.
- `Botnets`: These are networks of compromised devices, often referred to as bots or zombies, controlled by a central command-and-control (C2) server. Botnets can be exploited for a variety of harmful activities, including launching DDoS attacks, spreading spam, or disseminating other malware.
- `Rootkits`: These are stealthy forms of malware designed to gain unauthorized access and control over the fundamental components (the "root") of an operating system. They alter system functions to conceal their presence, making them extremely challenging to spot and eliminate. Attackers can utilize rootkits to maintain prolonged access and dodge security protocols.
- `Backdoors/RATs (Remote Access Trojans)`: Backdoors and RATs are crafted to offer unauthorized access and control over compromised systems from remote locations. Attackers can leverage them to retain prolonged control, extract data, or instigate additional attacks.
- `Droppers`: These are a kind of malware used to transport and install extra malicious payloads onto infected systems. They serve as a conduit for other malware, ensuring the covert installation and execution of more sophisticated threats.(Staged and unstaged in metaspoit)
- `Information Stealers`: These are tailored to target and extract sensitive data, like login credentials, personal information, or intellectual property, for harmful purposes. This includes identity theft or selling the data on the dark web.

Sample finding:

- [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/): An excellent resource for malware researchers, VirusShare houses a vast collection of malware samples. They currently have over 30 million samples in their repository, all of which are freely available to the public.
- [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/): This website allows us to submit files for malware analysis. However, they also have a public feed of their analyses, where malware samples are often shared.
- [TheZoo](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo): A GitHub repository that contains a collection of live malware for analysis and education. The repository also contains additional information about each sample, such as its family and the type of activities it performs.
- [Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/): This website provides traffic analysis exercises that can be extremely beneficial for people trying to learn about malware traffic patterns. They often provide pcap files of actual malware traffic, which can be quite informative.
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/): VirusTotal inspects items with over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blocklisting services, in addition to a myriad of tools to extract signals from the studied content. Any user can select a file from their computer using their browser and send it to VirusTotal. VirusTotal offers a number of file submission methods, including the primary public web interface, desktop uploaders, browser extensions and a programmatic API.
- [ANY.RUN](https://app.any.run/): An interactive online sandbox for malware analysis. The service allows researchers to analyze malware behavior by running samples in a controlled environment. While it offers both free and paid tiers, even the free version provides access to public submissions, which can include various malware samples.
- [Contagio Malware Dump](https://contagiodump.blogspot.com/): Contagio Dump is a collection of malware samples, threat reports, and related resources curated by a malware researcher named Mila. The site provides direct, anonymized access to an extensive range of malware samples, including various types of trojans, worms, ransomware, and exploits. It's frequently used by security researchers and analysts to study malware behavior and develop mitigation techniques.
- [VX Underground](https://www.vx-underground.org/): VX-Underground is one of the largest collections of malware source code, articles, and papers on the internet. It aims to collect, preserve, and share all kinds of materials related to malware, exploit, and hacking culture. This resource is valuable to security researchers and enthusiasts who want to study malware construction and behavior from a more technical and code-centric perspective.
